## Overview

We are creating an application to track departments, employees and tickets.

* Departments have a name and a floor.
	* ex. name: ‘IT’, floor: ‘Basement’
* Employees have a name, and level
	* ex. name: ‘Christina Aguilera’, level: 2
* Tickets have a subject, age (integer), and open (boolean) attributes
	* ex. subject: ‘printers broken’, age: 5, open: true

* Departments have many Employees
* Employees belong to a Department
* Employees have many Tickets
* Tickets can belong to many Employees

Some of the initial model set up and testing has been done for you.

## User Stories
```
Story 1
Department Index

As a user,
When I visit the Department index page,
I see each department's name and floor
And underneath each department, I can see the names of all of its employees
```
```
Story 2
Employee Show

As a user,
When I visit the Employee show page,
I see the employee's name and department name,
and I see a list of the employee's tickets including the ticket subject and age,
And I see that this list is ordered from oldest to youngest, 
And I see that this list only includes open tickets
```
```
Story 3
Unassign a Ticket from an Employee

As a user,
When I visit the employee show page,
Next to each Ticket I see a link/button to unassign the ticket from the employee.
When I click this link/button,
Then I am redirected back to that employee's show page
and I no longer see the ticket listed.
And when I visit another employee's show page that was assigned to that same ticket,
Then I see the ticket is still listed for that other employee.
```

## Extension
```
Extension
Top Employees

As a user,
When I visit the department index page,
Then I see a section for "Top Employees",
And in that section I see the names of the 3 employees
who have the highest count of closed tickets, 
and next to the employee name I see their count of closed tickets and their department
```
